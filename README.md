# PatientSymptomChecker
Prototype of a Symptom Checker chat bot for Facebook Messenger, using Isabel API to retrieve potential diagnoses based on entered symptoms.

A user enters their basic details, and symptoms they are experiencing, and the chatbot asks a few questions and responds with potential diagnoses, and further information about each of them.
